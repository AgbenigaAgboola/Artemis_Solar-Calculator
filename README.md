Solar energy remains one of the purest and easily adaptable source of renewable energy. It has not been adapted as it should in this part of the world majorly because of the cost of implementation and  knowledge gap.
Team Artemis Solar calculator aims to bridge some of the gap. The app was built to help users calculate the amount of solar power they require to power their homes by using their present power consumption as a baseline. This calculation can be used in the process of purchasing the required solar panels and batteries to suite their needs.
Major features of the app include its friendly User interface and ease of use. Users can select appliances from a predefined list (for people that don't know how to check the wattage of their appliance) or manually input their appliance name, power consumption is watts and get the results in a matter of seconds
We enabled a cart for easy addition and removal of appliances. An amazing feature of this app is that at user request they can easily send the details and results of their calculation to their email. The app is highly responsive and can work on any user device giving the same quality of service across all user platforms
